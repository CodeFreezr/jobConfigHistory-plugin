Enter the root directory for storing history information.
If left blank, history will be kept with the job itself. <br />
WARNING: If this path gets set or changed, already existing history files will not be found by the plugin any longer.
If you still want to have them listed, you must move them manually to the new root history folder.
<p>Either an absolute or relative path may be specified.  If a relative path is entered,
 it will be created below HUDSON_ROOT.  If an absolute path is entered,
the value will be used directly.</p>
